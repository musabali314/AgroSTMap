Spatio-Temporal Crop Monitoring via Drone-Based LiDAR and RGB Fusion

AgroSTMap is a spatio-temporal mapping framework for precision agriculture, designed to monitor crop growth over time using aerial LiDAR and RGB imagery. The system utilizes a custom-built drone equipped with a Livox Mid-360 LiDAR and IMU for weekly 3D scanning, alongside a DJI drone capturing high-resolution images from lower altitudes. Collected data is aligned across time using robust registration techniques (NDT, GICP) and fused with visual information to create a digital twin of the crop field. The framework supports visualization, growth tracking, and post-processing tools for crop height estimation, NDVI computation, and more. Built on ROS 1, this modular system emphasizes low-cost, high-frequency field monitoring, and can be scaled to multi-drone deployments in the future.
